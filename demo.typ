_How to Become a Human_ is a series of videos by #bili(..wagner) from Bilibili. It teaches aliens, AI, and doppelgangers how to blend into human society. The techniques taught in the videos range from walking@walk, eating@eat, to breathing@breath and sleeping. Actually, this kind of videos has its origin in an earlier video entitled _How to Distinguish between Shiba Inu and Bread_@dog-bread by #bili(..charon).
